# Amazon-Great-Indian-Festival-Python-Scraper

# This Python script allows you to track prices on Amazon using beautifulsoup. It will track pricing and give you email alerts when the target prices are met.

# You can do a lot with the scrapper, and you could construct a price alert program that will alert you through emails when the prices of a stock go up or down.
